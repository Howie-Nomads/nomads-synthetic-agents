Municipal Waste Processing Report â€“ Netherlands, 2022

Rotterdam waste-to-energy plants reported a 7% increase in biodegradable waste input, largely due to commercial pilot programs.
Key technical constraints:
- High cellulose content improves burn efficiency
- Non-degradable plastics in compostable packaging often clog machinery
- Baby products are typically incinerated unless separation is clearly defined

Pilot programs with hospitals and nurseries showed 18% improvement in stream separation with citizen education campaigns.
