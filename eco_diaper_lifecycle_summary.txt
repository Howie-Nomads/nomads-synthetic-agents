Eco-Diaper Lifecycle Summary

This document summarizes key data from a lifecycle assessment (LCA) of a biodegradable diaper prototype developed in 2023. Key findings include:

- 34% lower carbon emissions compared to standard disposable diapers
- Biodegradable core degrades 90% within 45 days in industrial composting conditions
- Packaging is made from 100% recycled paper, printed with soy-based ink
- Composting must occur in facilities with controlled humidity and microbial activity
- Not suitable for backyard composting
